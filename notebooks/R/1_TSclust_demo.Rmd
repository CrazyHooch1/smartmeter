# Introduction

In this notebook, smart meter data of households in London is analyzed using time series clustering techniques provided by the R-package `TSclust`. For clustering, the `hclust` method is used, running hierachical clustering. The dataset contains the 4411 households represented by the average hourly load of one year of recordings. 

```{r warning=FALSE, label = "Load libraries and data"}
library(tidyverse)
library(TSclust)
library(factoextra)

df = read_csv('../../data/interim/all_households_hourly.csv') %>%
  column_to_rownames("LCLid")
head(df)
```


```{r}
dis_mat = TSclust::diss(as.data.frame(t(df)), METHOD = "DTWARP")
hc = hclust(dis_mat, method = "ward.D2")
print(paste0("Correlation between cophenic distance and original distance: corr=", cor(dis_mat, cophenetic(hc))))
```

```{r}
fviz_dend(hc, cex = 0.5)
