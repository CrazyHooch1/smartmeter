**Smart meter data clustering using consumption indicators: Responsibility factor and consumption variability**

The wide spread of smart metering roll out enables a better understanding of the consumer behavior and tailoring demand response DR programs to achieve cost-efficient energy savings. In the residential sector smart metering allows detailed readings of the power consumption in the form of large volumes time series that encodes relevant information for distribution network operators DNOs to manage in optimal ways low-voltage networks. Further, DNOs may leverage the smart meter data to identify customer group for energy efficiency programs and demand side response DSR (e.g., dynamic pricing schemes). In this paper, we outline the application of smart meter data mining to identify consumers who are more responsible for the peak system using responsibility factor and consumption variability. Identification of consumers having higher responsibility to the peak system may yield to better enhance energy reduction recommendations and enable more tailored dynamic pricing plans depending on the consumer's influence on the utility peak. Responsibility factor and consumption variance have been investigated as input features of the clustering algorithms. Two clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering and self-organising map SOM, have been used to study the resulting customer groups and to have an effective graphical visualization of the customer's cluster distribution on the input feature space.

**Electricity consumption clustering using smart meter data**

Electricity smart meter consumption data is enabling utilities to analyze consumption information at unprecedented granularity. Much focus has been directed towards consumption clustering for diversifying tariffs; through modern clustering methods, cluster analyses have been performed. However, the clusters developed exhibit a large variation with resulting shadow clusters, making it impossible to truly identify the individual clusters. Using clearly defined dwelling types, this paper will present methods to improve clustering by harvesting inherent structure from the smart meter data. This paper clusters domestic electricity consumption using smart meter data from the Danish city of Esbjerg. Methods from time series analysis and wavelets are applied to enable the K-Means clustering method to account for autocorrelation in data and thereby improve the clustering performance. The results show the importance of data knowledge and we identify sub-clusters of consumption within the dwelling types and enable K-Means to produce satisfactory clustering by accounting for a temporal component. Furthermore our study shows that careful preprocessing of the data to account for intrinsic structure enables better clustering performance by the K-Means method.

**Load Shape Clustering Using Residential Smart Meter Data : a Technical Memorandum**

The rise of Advanced Metering Infrastructure has enabled large volumes of electricity consumption data to be captured at an hourly frequency or even higher. A thread of research has demonstrated methods for coupling this fast growing data stream with data mining techniques such as cluster analysis for categorization of electricity load patterns. In past research on residential customers, such categorization has usually been conducted on aggregated load data, partly due to large variability exhibited within and across customers. However, in the context of demand response and efficiency programs, load patterns of individual customers and their daily and inter-daily variability directly relate to each customer’s ability to respond to program incentives.
This document is a technical memorandum of application of an innovative clustering technique to individual customers’ daily load data resolved at the hourly level across a large sample of residential customers over a full year period. An additional innovation of our work is that we focus our analysis on the timing of discretionary1 electricity usage in particular, as opposed to total electricity use. We document the innovations and hyperparameter selection in the clustering process specific to our residential smart meter dataset and derive a diverse set of archetypical discretionary loadshapes.
While typically utilities and system operators focus on the aggregate residential load shape, application of this improved clustering method will shed light on the considerable heterogeneity and variability across days and customers. In the future, more behavioral features associated with household consumption schedules and variability can be extracted based on our results and can be used in future studies to segment customers for better program targeting and designing tailored recruitment strategies.
