**Smart meter data clustering using consumption indicators: Responsibility factor and consumption variability**

The wide spread of smart metering roll out enables a better understanding of the consumer behavior and tailoring demand response DR programs to achieve cost-efficient energy savings. In the residential sector smart metering allows detailed readings of the power consumption in the form of large volumes time series that encodes relevant information for distribution network operators DNOs to manage in optimal ways low-voltage networks. Further, DNOs may leverage the smart meter data to identify customer group for energy efficiency programs and demand side response DSR (e.g., dynamic pricing schemes). In this paper, we outline the application of smart meter data mining to identify consumers who are more responsible for the peak system using responsibility factor and consumption variability. Identification of consumers having higher responsibility to the peak system may yield to better enhance energy reduction recommendations and enable more tailored dynamic pricing plans depending on the consumer's influence on the utility peak. Responsibility factor and consumption variance have been investigated as input features of the clustering algorithms. Two clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering and self-organising map SOM, have been used to study the resulting customer groups and to have an effective graphical visualization of the customer's cluster distribution on the input feature space.

**Electricity consumption clustering using smart meter data**

Electricity smart meter consumption data is enabling utilities to analyze consumption information at unprecedented granularity. Much focus has been directed towards consumption clustering for diversifying tariffs; through modern clustering methods, cluster analyses have been performed. However, the clusters developed exhibit a large variation with resulting shadow clusters, making it impossible to truly identify the individual clusters. Using clearly defined dwelling types, this paper will present methods to improve clustering by harvesting inherent structure from the smart meter data. This paper clusters domestic electricity consumption using smart meter data from the Danish city of Esbjerg. Methods from time series analysis and wavelets are applied to enable the K-Means clustering method to account for autocorrelation in data and thereby improve the clustering performance. The results show the importance of data knowledge and we identify sub-clusters of consumption within the dwelling types and enable K-Means to produce satisfactory clustering by accounting for a temporal component. Furthermore our study shows that careful preprocessing of the data to account for intrinsic structure enables better clustering performance by the K-Means method.
