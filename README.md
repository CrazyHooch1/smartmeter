SmartMeter
==============================

In this project, the smart meter data of households in London are analyzed using different unsupervised learning techniques. 
The data was downloaded from this source: [London Datastore-SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data in London Households](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households)

State of the art
----

A SOTA was performed to find available ressources on smart meter data. See [SOTA](https://github.com/CrazyHooch1/smartmeter/blob/master/references/Readme.md) for more information
